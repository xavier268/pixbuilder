## Autostereogram

Autostrereogram(ASG) are images that can be viewed as stereo image (look it up in Wikipedia) without resorting to any external device.

ASG are computed using both a Pattern and a Depth-Map as input. Utilities are provided to generate these from standard png images.

See autostereogram_test for examples.
