Pixel by pixel image construction


## Autostereogram

Autostrereogram(ASG) are images that can be viewed as stereo image : look it up in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram) without resorting to any external device.

ASG are computed using both a Pattern and a Depth-Map as input. Utilities are provided to generate these from standard png images.

See autostereogram_test and example.png for examples.



## To do

Provide easily adjustable ways to maximize depth of stereo effect and adjust to screen/eye distance ?
